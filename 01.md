# Challenge 1: Digital Canvas - Released on December 5, 2023, 9:00 AM PST 

**Objective**

Craft a captivating story told through a sequence of 4-5 images, created using Stable Diffusion text-to-image, image to image models. Your task is to narrate a tale, where each image seamlessly leads to the next, creating a visual narrative. For eg, it could be a comic with 4 images. 

**Hints:**

  - Story Crafting: Start with a clear storyline. Think of each image as a chapter in your story 
  - Prompt Engineering: For each image, craft detailed prompts. The more specific you are, the better. However, avoid overly complicated prompts as they may lead to confusion. Include descriptors for subject, environment, mood, etc. Checkout different prompting techniques online if you are new to prompt engineering, here is a pdf on prompting for stable diffusion I found online 
  - Sequencing: Ensure each image has a logical or thematic connection to the next, maintaining a consistent narrative flow. 
  - Narrative Coherence: The challenge is to create a coherent visual story, where each image is both a standalone piece and a part of the larger narrative. 

**Technical setup**

Use the provided notebooks on IDC under `Gen AI Essentials` â€“ Stable Diffusion [text to image](https://github.com/rahulunair/genAI/blob/main/text_to_image.ipynb), [image to image](https://github.com/rahulunair/genAI/blob/main/image_to_image.ipynb) as the baseline for image generation. Experiment with different prompt nuances to see how they alter the narrative.  

**Documentation:** Document your thought process, prompt crafting, and how each image contributes to the overall story. 

**Difficulty:** Easy to Moderate (requires creative thinking and take time to craft interesting prompts)
